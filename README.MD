# 1. What is Javascript enginer?

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that you give JavaScript code to and it tells
the computer how to execute it. Basically a translator for the computer between
JavaScript and a language that the computer understands. But what happens inside of
the engine? Well, that depends on the engine. There are many JavaScript Engines out
there and typically they are created by web browser vendors. All engines are
standardized by ECMA Script or ES.
