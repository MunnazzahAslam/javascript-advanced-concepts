# 1. What is a Javascript engine?

A JavaScript engine is *a computer program that you give JavaScript code to and it tells the computer how to execute it*. 

It is a translator for the computer between JavaScript and a language that the computer understands. 

But what happens inside of the engine? Well, that depends on the engine. There are many JavaScript Engines out there and typically they are created by web browser vendors. All engines are standardized by ECMA Script or ES.
